`Blox` is a simple visualization package in Python, that helps you display infomation in an attractive way.


```{python}
from bloxs import B
```


```{python}
B(1234, "Bloxs in notebook!")
```




```{python}
B(1999, "Percent change!", percent_change=10)
```



```{python}
B("123", "ÂõæË°®", points=[1,4,2,3,5,6], chart_type="bar")
```


More over, `B` could used to combine and embed with `B` function just like the array


```{python}
B([
    B("123", "chart", points=[1,4,2,3,5,6], chart_type="bar"),
    B("123", "chart", points=[1,4,2,3,5,6], chart_type="line",color="red"),
    B("10000","the great number",points=[2,3,3,4,10],fill_color="green",border_color="green")
])
```

### Input some emoji


```{python}
B("üêõ")
```
