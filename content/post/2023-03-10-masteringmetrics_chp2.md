# Chapter 2 Regression

The question of whether college selectivity matters must be answered using the data generated by the rountine application, admission and matriculation decision made by students and universities of various types.

> The first and most step: isolate the seredipitous component of school choice is to hold constant the most obvious and important differences between students who go to private and state schools.

Why it is important? Because we hope to make other things equal. It the core of randomization.

We comparing universities’ earnings and we’ve assumed that all that matters for earnings besides college choice is the SAT score.

Instead of controling they work with a key summary measure: the characteristics of colleges to which students applied and were admitted.

Within-group comparisons should therefore be considerably more apples-to- apples than uncontrolled comparisons involving all students.





### Make me a match, Run me a regression

> regression estimates are weighted averages of multiple matched comparisons of the sort constructed for the groups in our stylized matching matrix.

The regression model in this context is an equation linking the treatment variable to the dependent variable while holding control variable fixed by includeing them in the model.

$$
Y+i=\alpha+\beta P_i+\gamma A_i+e_i
$$

- regression estimates provide a simple benchmark for fancier techniques. 
- Regression estimates are efficient in the sense of providing the most statistically precise estimates of average causal effect.

If we fail to include enough controls or the right controls will leave with selection bias. It is called omitted variables bias(OVB)

suppose the ommited variable $A_i$ and the treatment variable($P_i$) 
$$
\text{Effect of } P_i\text{ in short}=\text{Effect of }P_i\text{ in long}\\+(\{\text{Relationship bewteen ommited and included}\})\\\times\{\text{Effect of omitted in long}\}
$$
The effect of $P_i$ in short is what we want to estimate. And the omitted variable $A_i$ will give a interactive and long effect to estimation of $P_i$

Further more, we could difine the relationship
$$
A_i=\pi_0+\pi_1P_i+u_i
$$
$u_i$ is a residual.
$$
OVB=\text{Effect of }P_i\text{ in short} -\text{Effect of }P_i\text{ in long} =\beta^s-\beta^l=\pi_1\times \gamma
$$
$\gamma$ is the coefficient on $A_i$  in the long regression.



### Regression Sensitivity Analysis

We can estimate the $Short-Long$. To be precisely, both the short and long regressions include selectivity controls from the self-revelation model, as does the relevant auxiliary regression of own SAT scores on $P_i$.

With self-revelation controls included in both models, we have

The omitted variables may matter little. But regression still regression, we’d still rather have a real experiment.
