## Communication and punishment in voluntary contribution experiments

### background

-   in teams and other group, individuals are encouraged to undertake activities for the common good.
-   Experimentalists and theorists have studied the free-rider problem in public goods and common pool resource games.
-   the question: whether chat room or numerical cheap talk would facilitate a N.E. with no contributions.

## The former research

-   free form face-to-face communication in creasing contributions and efficiency(Issac and Walker,1988)
-   Effectiveness of face-to-face communication may be due to cues from facial expression
-   the e-mail communications less efficiency than face-to-face meeting(Frohlich and Oppenheimer,1998)

## Experimental design {.smaller}

-   16 subjects from general undergraduate

-   play a 10 period repeated VCM(voluntary contributions mechanism) game

-   Group: four

-   via computer terminals, couldn't communicate each other.

## Baseline treatment (B)

-   10 experimental dollars for each subject and allocate to group account

-   Each subject received 0.4 times the total amount in the group account.

The individual $i$ will receive the payoff: $$(10-C_i)+(0.4)\times \sum_{j=1}^4C_j$$

## Reduction treatment(R)

after the assignment, subject learned the other subject.

Reduce the earning of another subject at a 25 cent $$(10-C_i)+(0.4)\times\sum C_j-(0.25)\sum_{j=1}^4 R_{ij}-\sum_{j=1}^4 R_{ji}$$ The $R_{ij}$ is the number of i reduce j's earning.

## Face-to-Face communication treatment(FF)

-   Before the decision are made, have a change to talk for 5 min.

-   **Note:** The threats and promises are ruled out.

-   after reback to seat they don't know who is who talked.

-   Based on the Reduction treatment ran two **face-to-face sessions with reduction (FFwR)**. The FFwR is the same as its no-communication counterpart R except that group members talk for 5 min

## Chat room treatment(**CR**)

CR is based on B and brought together in an on-line chat room.

CRwR: Chat Room with Reduction treatment

## Numerical cheap talk treatment(**NCT**)

The NCT is the same as **B** except that Communication Stage: type in possible contribution levels.

-   type until the time ran out.

**NCTwR**: the treatment with numerical cheap talk and reductions(NCTWR) the subjects had the opportunity to type in possible punishments and possilbe contributions.

## Results and Analysis {.scrollable}

#### treatment R:

-   higher initial contributions

-   no decline in contributions until the end of the experiment

-   the absence of an overall earnings gain

-   subjects tended to increase their contribution following a punishment, if their contribution had been below the group mean.

    -   In Mann-Whitney test found that ave-contributions over 10 periods taken as a whole were significantly higher

```{r,fig.align='center',out.height='90%',out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("EE_files/p1_fig2.png")
```

## disscussion

the punishment changed the incentives to contribution.

-   the cost of punishing free rider and 22% punishment were at group's higest contributor
    -   the high contributor were punished to reduce their contribution by 0.5 in period t+1 for every \$1

## Results 2

-   the ave-contribution exceed in both B and R in every period.
    -   Mann-Whitney test FF significantly more than groups in B and R

## Results 3

-   on-line chat room was more effective in eliciting contributions to the group account.

-   The ave-contribution in CR was 15% less than in FF.

-   contributions in the CR were significantly higher than those in both the B and the R.

-   there is no significantly difference in either contributions or earnings among FF FFwR CRwR.

### discussion

-   member see the punishment as a trap to keep down their earning.

-   the punishment some free riding in the end game.

## results 4

-   the NCTwR has a stability of contributions.

-   the NCTwR were lower than FF,FFwR,CR and CRwR.

### discussion

subjects attempted to use misleading NCT message to generate opportunities to free ride.

## conclusion

-   communication of promises permitted high efficiency levels to be achieved in verbal communication treatments.

# Feedback,punishment and cooperation in public good experiments

## Introduction

how to promote cooperation when private and collective interest are at odds is a recurring theme in economics.

But little is known about whether cooperation established under the threat of peer punishment is robust to institutional changes.

## The experiment {.scrollable}

Subject: 124 student from U of Melbourne

Group: 4 individuals per group.

Endowment: 20dollar

Studied by Fehr and Gachter(2002) and two decision stages.

$$
\pi_i^1=20-c_i+0.4\sum_{h=1}^4c_h
$$

The first stage: player must decide simultaneously and without commutation.

$$
\pi_i^1=20-c_i+0.4\sum_{h=1}^4c_h-\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^4p_{ij}-2\sum_{j=1,j\neq i}^4p_{ji}
$$

## Results

## Punishment behavior {.scrollable}

Result 1. The likelihood that punishment will occur is unaffected by the feedback format.

Result 2. Punishment severity is the same in C and E, but is significantly higher in CE.

## contributions to the public account

Earnings feedback has a negative effect on contribution levels, while contribution feedback has a positive effect. The highest contribution levels are observed in C followed by CE and then E

## convergence of contributions

Result 4. Standard deviation of contributions decreases significantly over time in C and E where feedback is given in only one format, but not in CE where feedback is given in two different formats.

Result 5. Earnings feedback lowers the likelihood that a low contributor will respond to a punishment by raising his contribution in the following period.

Result 6. High contributors in E are more likely to lower their contribution in the following period than high contributors in either C or CE.

## Earning across treatment

Result 7. Earnings are significantly lower in treatments CE and E in which subjects receive earnings feedback compared to C in which subjects receive only contribution feedback.

## Alternative explanations

the results support the hypothesis feedback format serves as a coordination device that influences the level of cooperation.

### Confusion

-   Participants do not fully understand the experiment.

earning feedback help subjects discover their strategy.

### Imitation

-   information about earnings allows individuals to imitate the choice of the most successful of their peers.

### Experimenter effect

the subject have the other-regarding preference.

### Rank-based preference

subject have a preference for obtaining a higher number than their peers.

## Conclusion

cooperation sustained under the threat of peer punishment is indeed sensitive to changes in the format used to provide feedback to subject.

# Ownership,punishment and norms in a real-effort bargaining experiment

## Experimental design

-   subject:198 student

-   real effort task: subject must move sliders across the screen before time runs out.

### Advantage

-   not cognitively difficult that will reduces the potantial for differences in potential treatment effect.

-   it is not a fun or exciting: subjects will think the earn it due to his own costly efforts.

## In pairs

-   the surplus was created by joint production. if the subject who completed more sliders received the surplus.
-   Proposer Surplus treatment (PSt) the proposers received the entire surplus from the real effort task.
-   The Responder Surplus treatment(RSt) receive the entire surplus xfrom the real effort task.

**the surplus:** \$10 or \$0

## The bargain part

-   Each player was either the proposer or the responder remained the same.

-   The result was randomly select from the four games.

-   (8,2) could be proposed in each game.

-   subjects were told how many sliders they and their partner completed. and the surplus their partner received.

## Rule following task

There is five traffic lights. start walking by pressing botton.

began with 7 and spent 0.07 on each second of walking.

the lost of walking without waiting: $$
0.07*24=1.68
$$ The walking waiting all the lights $$
0.07*24+5*5*0.07=3.43
$$ This measure is simply capturing the experimental demand effect.

want to capture the individual difference between the follow a given costly or norm.

## Descriptive statistics

![](EE_files/p3_des1.png)

# Theoretical predictions

## social norm model {.smaller}

The individuals may judge an outcome as fair if it is more beneficial for themselves.

-   When there exist multiple potential norms, subjects who exhibit self-serving bias may select or place greater weight on the norm that suggests they should receive a greater share.

$$
U_i(x_i,x_j,\theta_i)=x_i-\gamma_i\cdot g(\theta_i(h)\cdot X-x_i)\quad if \quad \theta_i(h)\cdot X>x_i\\
U_i(x_i,x_j,\theta)=x_i,otherwise
$$

the $\theta_i(h)\in [0,1]$ Represents what the player i believes the norm suggest about the share of the surplus they should receive at the information set $h$

This give a norm-based share of the surplus for player $i$ as $\theta_i(h)\cdot X$

-   weak punishment: responders receive a payoff \$0 and proposers receive a payoff of \$2 if rejected.
-   strong punishment: both receive a payoff \$0 if rejected

## Alternative models

Both the outcome-based and intention-based models predict that there should be no difference in proposer or responder behavior between the RS and PS treatment.

## Result 1 {.scrollable}

-   with strong punishment, proposers in the Responder Surplus treatment were less likely to offer (8,2) compared with PS treatment
-   In the Responder Surplus treatment,proposers were more likely to offer (8,2) in Weak Punishment treatment compared with SP treatment

![](EE_files/p3_result1.png)

![](EE_files/p3_reg1.png)

## Result 2

-   SPT(Strong Punishment treatment), rejection rates of (8,2) by responder were similar between the Proposer and RPT.

-   in WPT responder were less likely to reject the (8,2) offer in the PS treatment compared with the RST(Responder Surplus Treatment)

## Result 3

SP(strong Punishment), the subject **in the Proposer Surplus treatment** who conditionally accepted or rejected the (8,2) the **Proposer Surplus treatment(PSt).**

(weak punishment,WP), RPT who conditionally accepted or rejected the (8,2) **PSt**.

## Result 4

-   Proposer follow the rule less likely to offer (8,2) in RS with PS treatment.

-   the Responders follow the rule are less likely to reject the PSt than RSt

-   responder who never waited at the light less likely to conditionally accept/reject the (8,2) offer.

## Conclusion

-   both the strength of enforcement and prior ownership in bargaining can influence the degree of conflict in negotiations.

-   Alternative models rely on social norms may provides a way to model the observed behavior in the experiment.

-   the rule-following task are more likely to respect prior ownership by proposer and responders.
